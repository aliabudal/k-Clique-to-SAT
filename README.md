# k-Clique to SAT Reduction:
The objective is to identify a polynomial reduction from the kClique problem,
to the SAT problem, its implementation in a programming language, and the comparison
of the running times between a script that solves kClique in exponential time and another that
solves the problem using an SAT solver.

# Structure:
1. Write an algorithm that runs in exponential time to solve the problem kClique. (Below we will refer to this as "backtracking", but you will not be limited to writing a backtracking algorithm, you can implement any algorithm that solves the problem in exponential time and correctly).
2. Finding a polynomial transformation 𝑇, by which we can reduce the kClique problem to the SAT problem and implementing it in a programming language. The reduction must be implemented both in a programming language and on paper, where you will demonstrate its correctness and the fact that it is polynomial.
3. Comparison of the execution time between the algorithm that runs in exponential time (the one implemented at 1) and the algorithm that implements the polynomial transformation + SAT solver provided in the skeleton. This "speedup" will be calculated by the checker on 3 categories of tests (divided based on certain criteria that you have identified). Your goal is to motivate in the README why in some cases the speedup is a good one and the reduction is favorable and why is it not in other cases.
4. BONUS: for requirement 3, you can include in the README graphics that highlight the connection between speedup and the input of the problem (the size of the clique, the number of nodes, the number of edges, or any other metric that you think would influence execution time). You can also create your own tests, highlighting what exactly does the running time of the 2 algorithms depend on. The bonus will be offered subjectively to each student depending on the quality of the explanations offered and their support through graphs / tests, that is, there will be partial scores.

# Input:
- On the first line there is a single number 𝑘, which represents the size of the clique searched in the graph
- On the second line there is a single number 𝑁, which represents the number of nodes in the graph 𝐺 (nodes will be represented by numbers from 1 to 𝑁; indexing starts from 1)
- On the third line there is a single number 𝑀, which represents the number of edges in the graph
- On the following M lines there are 2 numbers with a space between them, which represent the nodes which form an edge in the graph G

# Output:
1. For the first part (the algorithm in exponential time) the output will be a string:
- "True" if the kClique problem gives a positive answer to that input 
- "False" if the kClique problem gives a negative answer on the respective input

2. For the second part (implementing the polynomial transformation), the output will have to to be a Boolean formula in normal conjunctive form represented by a string of characters, in which:
- The variables will be coded as strings consisting only of letters and numbers (eg:𝑥1, 𝑥33, 78, 𝑦)
- The negation will be coded using the '~' character
- The disjunction (or logic) will be coded using the character '𝑉' (capital V)
- The conjunction (also logical) will be coded using the character '^'
- The clauses will be enclosed in round brackets (eg: “(𝑥1 ∨ ~𝑥2)”)

Depending on the transformation found, there may be several valid outputs for this part, the checker will check (with the help of an SAT solver) if the expression generated by you is satisfactory only in cases where KClique returns "True"; and false otherwise. In both parts, the output will have to be written to stdout.

# Requirements:
In order for the testing to work you will need to first install the library for the SAT solver, the one used here is z3-solver, you can run the following command to have it automatically installed:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Makefile:
You will have to modify the Makefile according to your language of choice, use the appropriate compiler or interpreter based on your language of choice. The one provided here is for the C language.

# Testing:
To run all tests, use the following command:
```
./check.sh all 
```
To run all tests only for the backtracking algorithm, use the following command:
```
./check.sh bkt
```
To run all tests only for the algorithm that solves the problem in exponential time, use the following command:
```
./check.sh rdc
```
To run tests only for a specific category, use the following command:
```
./check.sh category 1
```
or 
```
./check.sh category 2
```
or
```
./check.sh cateogry 3
```
